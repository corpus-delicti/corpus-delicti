#### A narrative game for 2 to 4 players
A heinous crime has shaken the community. To solve it, the best investigators have been gathered — and you are one of them.

## CHARACTERS
Describe your character. Maybe you're a slick agent who likes vodka in his coffee, an elderly writer with a prodigious mind, or a newly-installed AI in the homicide department. Write their name, description, and any relevant details on a piece of paper.

Once everyone has introduced their characters, distribute twelve dice equally among all players. From now on, the dice are called **Investigation Points**, and each player's set of dice is their **Pool**.

## THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR
Choose the first **Lead Investigator**. This role passes clockwise with each new scene. The lead is in charge of facilitating the scene, much like the game master in traditional role-playing games. Throughout the following scenes, all investigators may collaborate by making suggestions, but the Lead Investigator has the final say on what happens. The first **Lead Investigator** should be the player who most recently solved a crime (or the eldest, if no consensus is reached).

## THE CRIME SCENE
The first **Lead Investigator** describes the crime scene. They can add as much detail as they wish: how the victim was found, who they were, and how they were known. Most importantly: they must name the case (e.g., *The Butcher of Paris*, *The Black Widow*, or *Zodiac*). Write the victim’s name on one piece of paper, and the case name on another, and place them where everyone can see. Then, pass the lead to the left.

## THE EVEN SUSPECT
The next **Lead Investigator** must present the first suspect: the **Even Suspect**. They must explain how this person was implicated in the murder, their first name, who they are, and how they are known in the community. Write their name and relevant details on a visible piece of paper. Then, pass the lead to the left.

## THE ODD SUSPECT
The next **Lead Investigator** must present the second suspect: the **Odd Suspect**. They must explain how this person was implicated in the murder, their first name, who they are, and how they are known in the community. Write their name and relevant details on a visible piece of paper. Then, pass the lead to the left.

## THE INVESTIGATION
From this point on, a series of **Investigation Scenes** will follow, each with a new Lead Investigator. All players, including the lead, must describe the actions their characters take to gather information. When the scene has run its course, a vote takes place.

Each player may secretly wager any number of **Investigation Points** from their **Pool**, choosing whether to roll even numbers (if they believe the evidence points to the **Even Suspect**) or odd numbers (if they believe it points to the **Odd Suspect**). Players may bet 0 dice. However, the scene’s Lead Investigator must bet at least one **Investigation Point**.

Count how many dice show even results and how many show odd results. The **Lead Investigator** narrates the conclusion of the scene, incorporating the outcome of the vote.

* If there is an even majority, the evidence points to the Even Suspect.
* If there is an odd majority, the evidence points to the Odd Suspect.
* If there is a tie, the evidence is inconclusive or compromised.

Move the dice that voted for the winning suspect onto their corresponding paper. The other dice (those that voted for the losing suspect) go into a special pool called the **Epilogue Pool**.

Once all players have used up their **Pools**, there are no more investigation scenes, and it's time to resolve the case.

## SOLVING THE CRIME
If the **Lead Investigator** can no longer wager dice in the current scene, then instead of an **Investigation Scene**, they must present the game’s **Final Scene**. In this scene, the investigators discuss the clues, confront the murderer, and bring them to justice. Before starting the **Final Scene**, gather any leftover dice from other players’ pools and add them to the **Epilogue Pool**.

In this scene, players must piece together all the clues to construct a theory of what happened. This theory must accuse the suspect with the most Investigation Points on their paper as the murderer. Once the theory and culprit are chosen, the **Lead Investigator** narrates how justice is served and the killer is judged. As before, other players may contribute suggestions to the narrative.

## EPILOGUE
The final **Lead Investigator** runs an epilogue scene that takes place some undefined time after the crime was solved. It might be a deathbed confession, a newspaper letter, or a television interview. In it, the true culprit reveals the crime and their motives. Whether this happens from a jail cell or elsewhere depends on the dice.

The **Lead Investigator** rolls all the dice in the **Epilogue Pool**. Add even results to the **Even Suspect**’s paper and odd results to the **Odd Suspect**’s. After this twist of fate, compare the total number of dice assigned to each suspect.

If the declared culprit has the most dice, everyone can rest easy — justice was served. If not, an innocent person was wrongly convicted.
